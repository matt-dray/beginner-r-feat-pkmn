## Background

The document in this repo is an introduction to [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [R Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects), directory structure and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for beginners, with notes on why coding could help us do what we do.

Elements of this document may in future be incorporated into the [dfe-analytical-services/r-training-course](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/r-training-course) (work in progress).

## Presentation

Delivered originally in a workshop on 26 January 2018 for junior economists in a public sector department with little coding experience.

Materials also used in later training sessions within the department and also co-opted for use in other departments.
